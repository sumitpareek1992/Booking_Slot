# Booking_Slot
 You can see all table which is required for salon slot booking with login and signup functionality is working.
 
 As i got in requirements i done all the things like bootstrap , github commit in 2 hours and if you want UI like bookmyshow or paytm the need to create fron-end which will pass an integer as input
 to slot table instead of selection table then we will create char or Intger Field for stor list of integers.
 
 Now these all table are for super admin who can create salon , time , slot.
 
 now need to create new table for user so user can book slots for than we need to define many2one relation with other table
